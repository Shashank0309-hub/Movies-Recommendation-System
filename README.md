# Movies-Recommendation-System
I have created this project of Movies Recommendation System using Python and Streamlit and deployed & hosted on Heroku. Visit the website: http://ssk-mrs.herokuapp.com/

# Steps -> 
1. Export .csv files from Movie_data.zip.
2. Run "movie_recommender_system.ipynb" 
3. You will get 2 main files naming "movie_dict.pkl" containing dictionary of necessary attributes for running in the model and "similarity.pkl" containing data of similarities of movies with other movies.
4. Copy and paste these 2 files in "movie_recommender_system" Folder.
5. Pip Install Streamlit first for local hosting.
6. Run "app.py" file for model to work and get 5 similar movies on the basis of any 1 movie.
7. Setup Heroku and Upload the project on cloud for Hosting.
